## Challenges I ran into 🏇️

- I ran into the problem of deploying the contract on the theta network , it was my first time deploying to the theta blockchain

- Also i was using the protocols like Huddle01 and Livepeer for thr first time , It was quite challenging to implement all that but have to say their docs helped me a lot.
